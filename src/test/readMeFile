First of all, I thought about testing with API, but since I didn't have path and query parameters,
I didn't want to do the wrong test so I tested it with the user interface.

Then I create 3 different test cases for input 1,10,15. When I send input 1 it sends a different number every time that's
the bug that I found. The number should be unique and the same. For other test cases (10,15) it throws the same unique number
every time. I checked with expected and actual results and the expected result contained actual results that's why
we do not have any problem relating to these numbers.

I used TestNG but I can do that with Cucumber it will work properly too.

If you want me to do with API I can do that too but I need more information.

And I got the report with Extend Report I will add the result to the email. Extend Reports helps us to understand
everything with graphs.
